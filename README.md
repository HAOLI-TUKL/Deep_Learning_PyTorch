# Deep_Learning_PyTorch
deep learning implementation including Fizzbuzz game, image classification, transfer learning , style transfer and GAN based on PyTorch using Python

## FizzBuzz Game
FizzBuzz game is a simple game. We count from 1 and say fizz, buzz and fizzbuzz respectively when the multiple of 3 or 5 or 15 occurs.
A simple two layer network is traine based on PyTorch for this task, and the result is below.
